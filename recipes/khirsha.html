    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup aromatic rice (preferably Gobindobhog or Kalijira rice)</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>4-5 green cardamom pods, crushed</li>
        <li>A handful of raisins and chopped nuts (optional)</li>
        <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
        <li>Ghee (clarified butter) for frying the rice</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h3>Steps</h3>    
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain the water and set the rice aside.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a deep-bottomed pan or kadhai over medium heat. Add the drained rice and sauté for a few minutes until the rice turns slightly golden.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, bring the milk to a boil. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the sautéed rice. Stir gently to avoid sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice in the milk on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the rice becomes tender and the mixture thickens. This may take around 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed cardamom pods, sugar, raisins, and chopped nuts (if using) to the rice mixture. Stir well and continue to cook for another 10 minutes until the sugar dissolves and the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>If desired, add a pinch of saffron strands to the khirsa for an extra touch of flavor and color. Mix it well.</li>
        <li>Once the khirsa reaches the desired consistency and the flavors have infused, remove it from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Serve the khirsa warm or chilled, garnished with more chopped nuts and saffron strands if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cautions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Exercise caution while frying the rice in ghee to avoid any hot oil splatters.</li>
        <li>Be careful when adding the sautéed rice to the boiling milk to prevent any splashing.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the rice and milk mixture while cooking to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Handle the hot mixture carefully to avoid burns while stirring or serving.</li>
        <li>When adding saffron strands, ensure they are of good quality and free from contaminants.</li>
        <li>Take into consideration any nut or saffron allergies of individuals consuming the dish.</li>
    </ul>
