    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yogurt (as a starter culture)</li>
        <li>A pinch of cardamom powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Chopped nuts for garnish (e.g., pistachios or almonds)</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h3>Steps</h3>    
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer the milk, stirring occasionally, until it reduces to approximately half its original volume. This process may take around 45 minutes to an hour, resulting in a thick and creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar to the reduced milk and stir well until it completely dissolves. Taste and adjust the sweetness according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the sweetened milk to cool down to lukewarm temperature.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, take two tablespoons of yogurt and add a few spoons of the cooled milk to it. Mix well to create a smooth mixture without any lumps.</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk and sugar. Stir gently to combine everything thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Optionally, sprinkle a pinch of cardamom powder into the mixture for enhanced flavor.</li>
        <li>Cover the saucepan with a clean cloth or a lid, and let it sit undisturbed in a warm place for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. This allows the mixture to ferment and set into a thick and creamy Mishti Doi.</li>
        <li>Once the Mishti Doi has set, refrigerate it for a few hours or overnight to chill and enhance its flavor.</li>
        <li>Serve the Mishti Doi chilled in individual bowls or clay pots. Garnish with chopped nuts, such as pistachios or almonds, for added texture and presentation.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Cautions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use caution when simmering the milk to prevent it from boiling over. Stir occasionally to avoid burning the milk at the bottom of the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the yogurt used as a starter culture is fresh and contains active cultures. This helps in the fermentation process and ensures a good set for the Mishti Doi.</li>
        <li>Maintain a warm and undisturbed environment while setting the yogurt to achieve the desired consistency. Avoid moving or jostling the saucepan during this time.</li>
        <li>Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preferences. Start with a lesser amount and gradually add more if desired.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Indulge in the creamy sweetness of Mishti Doi, and relish the authentic flavors of Bengali cuisine!</p>
